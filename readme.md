This repository contains material for SISBID module on Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning. 

Please note that the module numbers may change in different years when SISBID is offered. Therefore, the past material for this module are archived under the name "Module 4". However, the content corresponds to mateiral for the Supervised Machine Learning module. 

## Pre-Recorded Lectures

We have pre-recorded some of the lectures. Links to these *pre-recorded lectures* are given below (the password for accessing these files will be sent to participants separately):

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 1: [Introduction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t9yrnrgjqsyva2q/PrerecordedLecture1_Intro.mov?dl=0)

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 2: [R Lab 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6zf4kzlgo4o6u4/PrerecordedLecture2_Rlab1.mp4?dl=0)

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 3: [R Lab 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r1n86c213qifca1/PrerecordedLecture3_Rlab2.mp4?dl=0)

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 4: [Batch Effects](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tz3pewgd3izc4m/PrerecordedLecture4_BatchEffects.mov?dl=0)

Please watch videos 1-3 (all related to the first set of slides, SISBID1.pdf) before the first class. You can watch video 4, on batch effects, at any point -- we wil briefly go over the topic after the lecture on classification, but will not discuss it extensively. 

Finally, here are two more pre-recorded lectures (same password as before): 

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 5,6: [slides 6 and 8](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1c0xhprwxp6up2m/AADB04YYC72zaNiwRLTif4MAa?dl=0)

We will cover the material from these last two videos during the last day of the module, depending on how much time is left.
