This repository contains material for SISBID module on Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning. 

Please note that the module numbers may change in different years when SISBID is offered. Therefore, even though this the name of this repository is "Module 4", the content corresponds to mateiral for the Supervised Machine Learning module. 

## Pre-Recorded Lectures

**For 2020**, we have pre-recorded a few lectures. Links to these *pre-recorded lectures* are given below (the password for accessing these files will be sent to participants separately):

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 1: [Introduction](https://washington.zoom.us/rec/share/2fduFoPc-0dIb43G7x_CarItRIP_X6a803UX-_IFxU9OBx3RGrp2LsOCtsbn2oYO?startTime=1594352701000)

Please watch videos 1-3 (all related to the first set of slides, SISBID1.pdf) before the first class. You can watch the video 4, on batch effects, at any point -- we wil briefly go over the topic after the lecture on classification, but will not discuss it extensively. 

Finally, here are two more pre-recorded lectures (same password as before): 

- SISBID Pre-Recorded Video 5,6: [slides 6 and 8](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v5fyl8kks0nb1zv/AACGcFXHpHa8F_dPPKh9oUlUa?dl=0)

We will cover the material from these last two videos during the last day of the module, depending on how much time is left.
